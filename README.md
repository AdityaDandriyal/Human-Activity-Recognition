**HUMAN ACITIVITY RECOGNITION using Deep Learning**

**DESCRIPTION**

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a rapidly evolving field that combines the power of computer vision and machine learning 
to classify and understand human actions from visual data. 
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to automatically recognize and categorize human activities into 
predefined categories using video or image data.

With applications ranging from healthcare and surveillance to sports analytics and human-computer interaction, 
HAR systems aim to bridge the gap between human behavior and machine interpretation. 
The project employs state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 
to extract spatial and temporal features that capture the essence of various activities.

**OBJECTIVE**
Our objective is to build a robust and accurate model that can classify activities like walking, running, sitting, jumping, and more, using video datasets. 

**DATASET**

In this project we worked on a subset of **UCF-101 dataset** in which we considered only 21 classes of human activity/actions instead of the original 101.

**DATA-PREPROCESSING**

A video consists of an ordered sequence of frames. Each frame contains **spatial information**, and the sequence of those frames
contains **temporal information**. To model both of these aspects, we use a hybrid architecture that consists of **convolutions** (for spatial processing) as well as
**recurrent layers** (for temporal processing).
